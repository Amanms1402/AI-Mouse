Transforming the conventional mouse experience, my latest project is an AI mouse driven by hand gestures, crafted through independent work in just 9 days. Leveraging machine learning and OpenCV, this innovation allows users to seamlessly navigate interfaces with a simple wave or gesture. Witness the fusion of cutting-edge technology and creative design, showcasing my commitment to pushing the boundaries of human-computer interaction. This project is a testament to my passion for innovation and dedication to exploring new horizons in the realm of artificial intelligence and robotics. 🚀🖐️🐭 #AIMouse #TechInnovation
